# Make it Make Sense MadLibs READ.md

This is my READ.md for my Python Final Project Titled 'Make it Make Sense'

# Overview of Game

I have made a MadLibs generator which allows users to run the program and a box of text pops up allowing them to choose from 3 creative narratives that I have created. It asks them for each of the needed commands and then once they are done filling it out, it yields the fully filled out MadLib and allows them to continue to fill out the remaining ones by clicking on the remaining tabs of the pop up screen. 

# Challenges

Some of the challanges I had to overcome were tyring to figure out how to create buttons in order for the user to be able to choose which MadLib they wanted to fill out first. I had to do a lot of research surrounding commands and variables in Python which ultimately led me to having to change my original vision a little, but I was not dissapointed with the outcome itself.
